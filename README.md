In this project we have driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc). Your goal is to predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. 
The 10 classes to predict are:

 *   c0: safe driving
 *   c1: texting - right
 *   c2: talking on the phone - right
 *   c3: texting - left
 *   c4: talking on the phone - left
 *   c5: operating the radio
 *   c6: drinking
 *   c7: reaching behind
 *   c8: hair and makeup
 *   c9: talking to passenger
